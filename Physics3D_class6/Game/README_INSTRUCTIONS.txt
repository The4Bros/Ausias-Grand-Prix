GOAL OF THE GAME: With your car, you have to make a better time/lap than the stablished time to win. Once you've won,
the game will restart. Once the game is restarted,if you want to continue playing, you can but the time to win is going to 
be 1 second more difficult. To make this time/lap the player will have a limit of 4 minutes. If in 4 minutes + the final lap the player hasn't beat
the time to win, the game will restart. 

Bonus: The game has a tricky ramp, if you take it and you jump pretty far, you will get a 5 sec bonus time for the lap(current lap, not old lap), the ramp leads you to 
a curve so is not very easy to take the ramp and land perfectly to make thoes 5 seconds worth. But it's possible.

Note : always that the game restarts it show to you the best lap time, but  this time does not work to win. It's just a reference to you.
